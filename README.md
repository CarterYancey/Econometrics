# Econometrics
Project assignments from econometrics class I took at The University of Alabama, Spring 2020

ps513.pdf Details the questions being answered in each project set.

The .R files are the r code used to produce the pdf reports (included) that I submitted for the class.

The xls files are the data sets used in the projects. Since I was running strictly on a Linux machine at the time, I converted them to csv for use in my r code. I included the original format here, so they would have to be converted again or the source code changed in order to run the r files succesfully again.
